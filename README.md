# Hangman
## Description
This is a hangman game for windows that runs through the console.  It has working audio (assuming you have the `Sounds` folder in the same directory as the exe), and choosing a random word of different lengths depending on your difficulty choice.

## Usage
The executable can ran through openning it directly or through the console.  There are no command line arguments.

The directory that the executable is in should look something like this:
```
Sounds/
Hangman.exe
easy.txt
medium.txt
hard.txt
extreme.txt
<Any other files you want>
```

Then in the `Sounds` directory, you should have the following:
```
This will be updated
```

All of this will be prepared as required in the zip file which can be found here (turn this "here" into a hyperlink to a public google drive folder with the zip).
