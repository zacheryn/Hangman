# Hangman
## Description
This is a hangman game for windows that runs through the console.  It has working audio (assuming you have the `Sounds` folder in the same directory as the exe), and choosing a random word of different lengths depending on your difficulty choice.

## Usage
The executable can ran through openning it directly or through the console.  There are no command line arguments.

The directory that the executable is in should look something like this:
```pre
.
├── Hangman.exe
├── Sounds
│   ├── correct.wav
│   └── wrong.wav
├── easy.txt
├── extreme.txt
├── hard.txt
├── medium.txt
└── <Any other files you want>
```

All of this will be prepared as required in the zip file which can be found in the latest [release](https://github.com/zacheryn/Hangman/releases/latest/).  Alternatively, you can directly download the [archive](https://github.com/zacheryn/Hangman/releases/latest/download/Hangman.zip).
